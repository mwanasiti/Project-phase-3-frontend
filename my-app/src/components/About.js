          <p>_Sustained momentum in public sector reforms_
Since 1980s, the government has seen a renewed momentum in improving service delivery. The civil service reform program was adopted in early 1990s aimed to build a public service workforce that was responsive to the needs of the citizens. Under the economic recovery strategy, the reform agenda includes efforts to nurture and instil attitudinal change in the public service. Further, the Kenya Vision 2030 identifies public sector reforms as key in the transformative agenda with expectation that public service is citizen-focused and results-oriented institutions in serving a rapidly growing economy and society.</p>
